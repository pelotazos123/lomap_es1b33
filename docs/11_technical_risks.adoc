== Risks and Technical Debts

“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

_(It will obviously be extended as we find new risks and generate others technical debts as we develop the application.)_

.Risks
|===
|Priority |Problem description |Considerations

|Medium
|Huge dimension of the project
|The quality and readability of the developement solutions are mandatory in order to keep order

|Medium
|Time availability of memebers of the developement team
|Good organization and distribution of the project work along the semester

|===

.Technical Debts
|===
|Relevance |Technical Debts | Considerations

|Medium
|Mandatory use of SOLID
|Although it may be a great solution to the problem faced, the obligation to use this technology sets a new handicap to the start of the developement

|Medium
|Learning techincal material along the semester
|The discovery of some of the technologies of the project and some of good strategies will take place as we attend the course lectures, which coincide with the developement period

|Medium
|Performance of external resources
|The use of external resources can result in a lack of efficiency. Not only due to its functioning in general and in execution but also to the efficiency of the work performed by the team.

|Low
|The usage of TypeScript and React
|Even though the advises of our professors may conduct us to use these technologies, we are not familiar with them

|Low
|Lack of relation between members of the team
|Most probably it will not be a big deal, but the fact that we do not know each other may difficutl at least the beggining of the developement (Actualization: regarding the developement of the project, it actually was a high priority issue).
