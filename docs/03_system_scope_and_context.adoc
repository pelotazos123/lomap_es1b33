### Technical Context

According to the *SOLID project*, shared information will be stored in each user's POD in order to preserve the privacy of the data. In addition, we will implement the application using *TypeScript* together with React. Besides, different types of tests are going to be necessary. Finally, it is mandatory to tell that the LoMap system is going to use the *Google Maps API* in order to provide the service of the map in the application.
