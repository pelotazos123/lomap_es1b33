## Architecture Constraints

### Technical constraints

|===
|*Constraint*|*Explanation*
|*SOLID*| SOLID pods will be used to store the data.
|*Docker*| The application is to be deployed using docker.
|*GitHub*|GitHub will be used as a git host. Through this, we will manage version control, 
communication, actions and the project itself.

### Organizational and political constraints
|===
|*Constraint*|*Explanation*

|*Team composition*
|The team will consist of 1 single members with a small and limited experience in the technologies that will be used.

|*Meetings*
|In each laboratory, there will be a meeting to discuss the next week tasks. In case of any extraordinary meeting to be needed,
it will be agreed byboth of us and recorded in the activity. Those minutes will be found here https://github.com/pelotazos123/lomap_es1b33/wiki[here].     

|*Comunication*
|Taking advantage of being working in such a small team, the comunication between the members can be done very easily. However, we have to be able to persist the important decisions regarding the project.

|*Testing*
|There will be different scenarios that will test the proper behaviour of the application.

|*Deliveries*
|To check on the project progress there will be several deliveries through the time.

### Conventions
|===
|*Constraint*|*Explanation*

|*Documentation*| It will be used https://arc42.org/[Arc32] template for keeping a simple and clean documentation.
|*Clean code*| The code must be clean and well written to keep it easier to work with and mantain.
|*Accessibility*| The interface must be easy to understand and to navigate through for every possible non-technical user.
|*SOLID*| The code must follow the Solid project conventions.
|*Language*| We will try that the most part of the official contribution to the project is done in english so it is the most global possible.
