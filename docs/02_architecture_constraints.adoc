|*Meetings*|In each laboratory, there will be a meeting to discuss the next week tasks. In case of any extraordinary meeting to be needed,
it will be agreed by every team member and recorded in the activity. This meetings will need a lot of coordination due to the
different schedules that we have. The record of each meeting can be found here https://github.com/Arquisoft/lomap_es1b/wiki[here].     
Necessary to take into account that one of the members won't be able to assist to the lab meetings due to working reasons, but will work remotely.
