## Architecture Constraints

### Technical constraints

|===
|*Constraint*|*Explanation*
|*SOLID*| SOLID pods will be used to store the data.
|*Docker*| The application is to be deployed using docker.
|*GitHub*|GitHub will be used as a git host. Through this, we will manage version control, 
communication, actions and the project itself.
|===

### Organizational and political constraints
|===
|*Constraint*|*Explanation*

|*Team composition*
|The team will consist of 1 single members with a small and limited experience in the technologies that will be used.

|*Meetings*
|Previously, as the application was being developed by a bigger team, weekly meeting took over. Those minutes can be found here https://github.com/pelotazos123/lomap_es1b33/wiki[here].     
Anyways, as a single member, there is no need to hold new meetings, as long as the repository is being used properly.

|*Comunication*
|Taking advantage of being a single member, decisions don't need any discussion. Anyways it'll be neccessary to be wary of myself and don't think twice about the decisions.

|*Testing*
|There will be different scenarios that will test the proper behaviour of the application.

|*Deliveries*
|There will be a final delivery the 4th of July to show the whole project.

### Conventions
|===
|*Constraint*|*Explanation*

|*Documentation*| It will be used https://arc42.org/[Arc32] template for keeping a simple and clean documentation.
|*Clean code*| The code must be clean and well written to keep it easier to work with and mantain.
|*Accessibility*| The interface must be easy to understand and to navigate through for every possible non-technical user.
|*SOLID*| The code must follow the Solid project conventions.
|*Language*| We will try that the most part of the official contribution to the project is done in english so it is the most global possible.
