## Project Description: Your Personalized City Mapping Tool 🗺️

The software development company HappySw has been hired by the Council of Brussels to develop LoMap, a cutting-edge software system that will revolutionize the way citizens interact with their city.

LoMap goes beyond ordinary mapping tools, providing users with personalized maps of their city that include local businesses, shops, bars, restaurants, sights, and cultural attractions, all tailored to their interests. With LoMap, users have the flexibility to create and customize their own maps, making every outing a unique and customized experience.

In addition, LoMap prioritizes security and privacy, built on the [SOLID principles](https://solidproject.org/) to ensure that users' shared information is stored securely in their personal pod, under their control at all times.

Join us on this exciting journey to create an extraordinary mapping experience for citizens of Brussels and beyond. If you're interested in contributing to this project, check out the "How to Contribute" section above and be a part of this innovative mapping solution! 🚀🗺️

## Using the application: Deploy your own LoMap 💻

1. Compile and run the webapp:

	```shell
	cd ../webapp
	npm install
	npm start
	```

2. You should be able to access the [application](http://localhost:3000), but hopefully it will start by itself.
